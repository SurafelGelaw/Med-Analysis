      Developer's Words:
    </h2>
<b>
 I developed this application because i have seen the pain and frustration of people through out </br>
 my country in the non-digital world of our hospital system, which does not allow paitents to get </br>
 treatment at the required time. This made me think through the possibility of introducing the digital</br>
 world to the manual, so that people could get access at the exact time and get the help they needed.This</br>
 is a digital representation of the data held in hospitals to improve the well being of paitents so that</br>
 they could get the proper treatment without delay and also it is a satisfaction for me to know that i have</br>
 contributed a little amount of my potential to the society that brought me up and helped me grow.The inability</br>
 to treat people efficiently because of the problems occuring in the manual area made me step up to the fact that</br>
 i want to help people and their service at the affected area which is developing the manual system and upgrading</br>
 it intothe digital world where we can access and store the data adequately in a proper manner. We need to develop</br>
 into a more easy and understandable way of system.</b>
